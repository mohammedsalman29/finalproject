This project is an AI-powered Emotion Detection System that uses facial expression recognition to identify human emotions from images or video in real time. It leverages OpenCV for image processing and deep learning models for emotion classification, enabling applications in fields such as mental health analysis, user experience research, and human-computer interaction.
